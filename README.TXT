SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR SERVER SIDE
- Apache 2.2, Apache 2.4 or newer (should also work with other HTTP servers like Nginx or IIS [compatibility with IIS confirmed by users]);
- PHP 5.6, PHP 7 or newer (should also work with older versions of PHP 5, but they are not supported anymore...);

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR LABELS PRINTING
- DYMO LabelWriter 450/DYMO LabelWriter 450 Turbo or compatible DYMO LabelWriter printer with 99012 labels, if you wish to use the existing Badge template as is.
- IPP server must be used for sharing the printer (only tested with CUPS), but should also work with IPP network label printers. Of course, a linux client can be used as IPP server or if you use a Windows client, you can use a rasperry Pi, other a card board, or a virtual machine with Linux to share the printer with CUPS.

ABOUT

T.C.E.D.I. Open Visitors Management System allows visitors to check-in from web client front end.
Depending on the configuration, the visitors may be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement with your company.
Once the visitor has performed check-in and signed the non-disclosure agreement (if required), a visitor badge is
automatically printed on a label printer by the system.
For the visitors (main.php) and receptionist (reception-view.php) front ends, data base user needs the rights to add (INSERT) and modify (UPDATE) records, but 
no need to remove (DELETE) or execute (EXECUTE).
For administrator frontend (admin.php), data base user needs the right to remove (DELETE) for using the feature to clear the database.

htaccess.dist file (basis for an .htaccess file) is included for Apache.

INSTALL

- Uncompress the archive into a directory and edit "settings.php" variables for your company.
- Replace the image "badgelogo.jpg" by the logo of your company. The image should be of size 188x136 and in grayscale.
- [Can be done later] If you use an Apache server, you should use "htaccess.dist" as a basis to create your own ".htaccess" file. If you use another HTTP server, use "htaccess.dist" as a hint for securing accesses to administration and reception view pages.
- [If you've set $bShowAdditionalMessageBeforeBadgePrint to true], edit "messagebeforeprinttemplate.html" (or use one of the Sample templates provided as a basis) with your favourite editor in "languages -> LanguageName" sub-folders, for every language you wish to use.
- If you are not going to use Dymo 99012 Large Address Labels with a compatible Dymo LabelWriter printer, you should adapt badgetemplate.php (or use one of the Sample templates provided as a basis) with your favourite text editor in "languages -> LanguageName" sub-folders, for every language you wish to use. For more details on FPDF use, please consult "./fpdf/doc/index.htm".
- Then, upload these files to your web server.
- You should then create a database "CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS visitors CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;" and a user (visitors or else) to access it (minimum privileges: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE). If you wish to use "install.php" to create the table, CREATE and ALTER rights are also required (at least for setup).
- Once the database and user are created and configured (of course these ones must match your configuration in "settings.php"), you can either enter the address of "install.php" in your browser or  create the table manually:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS visitors 
(
 visitorID int(10) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
 PRIMARY KEY(visitorID),
 Location VARCHAR(50),
 FirstName VARCHAR(255),
 LastName VARCHAR(255),
 Company VARCHAR(255),
 Visiting VARCHAR(255),
 Email VARCHAR(255),
 vehicleonsite INTEGER,
 licenseplate VARCHAR(25),
 Legal VARCHAR(10),
 inDate VARCHAR(30),
 outDate VARCHAR(30),
 SignOutFlag Binary 
);

- The setup is now finished, you can use your browser to access T.C.E.D.I. Open Visitors Management System.

UPGRADE

- Uncompress the archive into a directory and edit "settings.php" variables for your company using your current "settings.php" as a basis.
- [For upgrade from the original version of phpVisitorBadge] Replace the image "badgelogo.jpg" by the logo of your company. The image should be of size 188x136 and in grayscale.
- [Can be done later] If you use an Apache server, you should use "htaccess.dist" as a basis to create your own ".htaccess" file. If you use another HTTP server, use "htaccess.dist" as a hint for securing accesses to administration and reception view pages.
- [If you've set $bShowAdditionalMessageBeforeBadgePrint to true], edit "messagebeforeprinttemplate.html" (or use one of the Sample templates provided as a basis) with your favourite editor in "languages -> LanguageName" sub-folders, for every language you wish to use. If your are currently using phpVisitorBadge Enhanced, you can reuse a part of the content of "messagebeforeprinttemplate.html" to prepare the new version of the file.
- If you are not going to use Dymo 99012 Large Address Labels with a compatible Dymo LabelWriter printer, you should adapt badgetemplate.php (or use one of the Sample templates provided as a basis) with your favourite text editor in "languages -> LanguageName" sub-folders, for every language you wish to use. For more details on FPDF use, please consult "./fpdf/doc/index.htm".
- Then, upload these files to your web server.
- You should then use the appropriate SQL upgrade script to perform the required changes to your current database. If you are using phpVisitorBadge Enhanced, you should use "SQL Upgrade Script from phpVisitorBadge Enhanced 2.00 BETA 8.sql". If you are using phpVisitorBadge, you should use "SQL Upgrade Script from phpVisitorBadge.sql". Some changes may have to be applied to the scripts to match your current setup, before upgrade. Please ensure that the user you'll use to perform the upgrade has enough rights.

TRANSLATIONS

- To create a new translation, you just have to make a copy of the "English" sub-folder inside "languages" folder and rename it into the destination language name (without special character).
- Then translate the values in all PHP files (please follow the instructions, if available) ;
- Then translate the content of all HTML files (please follow the instructions, if available) ;
- Finally replace the image "lang.png" by the flag(s) corresponding to the language of the translation. The image should be of size 300x160 in colors (RGB).

If you wish to remove/disable a translation, move or cut and paste the folder containing the translation outside "languages" folder. For example, in a new folder named "disabled-languages".
